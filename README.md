###Description
Web application that finds a wheelchair accessible route through Philadelphia's public transit system, via an implementation of Dijkstra's  Graph Search Algorithm. Built using Python, Flask, Javascript, SQLAlchemy, and Jinja, and integrating the Google Place Autocomplete and Google Geocoding APIs. This project was inspired by a Philadelphian friend who uses a wheelchair and is frustrated with the lack of tools available for planning accessible trips.
